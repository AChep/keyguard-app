Everything else, such as Launchpad.net, cloud file storage, AskUbuntu, and other accounts should be closed first if possible. This is especially important if you have any paid services attached, to make sure you won't be billed for anything after closing the accounts. The last step is to delete your Single Sign-On (SSO) account. SSO accounts must be deleted manually by the Ubuntu One staff."

In exceptional circumstances (e.g. death, legal threats, security risks) you may contact a moderator to request that your account be marked as inactive or placed in the penalty box. The site also refuses to delete a large amount of posts on your behalf, so the best solution may be to turn on 2FA, change your username/email address to something that's not used elsewhere and not login anymore."
